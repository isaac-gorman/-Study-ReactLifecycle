// THE REACT LIFECYCLE

// Module Summary:
// - Every React component contains what is known as the React Lifecycle.
// - This React Lifecycle is just one piece of how components operate in vanilla JS.
// - The React Lifecyle contains a few magical "Methods" on it, and learning how to use them, will help me understand why the React library behaves and acts the way it does at certain times.

// Module Learning Objectives:
// 1) Model and graph the three stages of the React Component Lifecycle
// 2) Ablitly to define two important methods in the React Component Lifecycle and be able to explain their significance in the lifecycle:
// -- "constructor"
// -- "render"
// 3) Render a component's state using the 'componentDidMount()' function.
